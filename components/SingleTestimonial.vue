  <blockquote>As a educator myself who's made it my life's work to effectively help people learn and retain what they're learning, I'm extremely impressed by Josh's approach to teaching. It's abundantly clear that Josh knows what he's doing. Students will come away from this course with the skills they need to be more productive at CSS, paying back their investment many times over.</blockquote>
